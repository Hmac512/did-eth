Evolution of did:ethr: https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did

## Objective:
Our objective is to collaboratively design and come up with a new did method proposal that is generally compatible with ethereum virtual machine (EVM) blockchains. It is critical that the did method be collaboratively designed and governance be done by a neutral entity in order to maximize the possibility of wide adoption and potential for standardization across EVM compatible chains.

## Background: 

The project idea was started at the Internet Identity Workshop in November 2022. Please see meetings page for additional updates. https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth/tree/main/meetings
